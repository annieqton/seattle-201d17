- Announcements
  - Schedule for the next two days with potential weather considerations:
    - The NWS says snow will start in the afternoon and move south-to-north through the PS region through the evening.
    - Because of that, those from the southern areas might want to leave a little earlier this afternoon to get ahead of any traffic.
    - We're definitely going to get snow, but the effect of it on tomorrow is still hard to anticipate. Could be none, or could be huge. And it'll probably vary a bit from Tacoma to Seattle to Everett.
    - We'll basically follow the lead of the local schools here: if places like UW, Seattle City Schools, etc., call a snow day, we probably will, too. If not, we'll operate as usual with the understanding that some of you from more impacted areas might not be able to make it. I'll make an @channel announcement on Slack if we decide to call a snow day. Absent that, assume business as usual.
    - In the event we call a snow day, a make-up session will be scheduled TBA (we'll discuss details later, if that happens).
    - The labs on each of the next two days are of much lower intensity than the others this week, and easier to work at on your own, leaving you room to get caught up on the Mon-Wed labs.
  - Thursdays noon-1: Office hours with the Admissions team in the front lounge area, if you'd like to talk with Karinne and/or Mindy about your next steps. Feel free to talk to Sam or the TAs for any general advice you seek.
  - Starting this afternoon, in lab time, Sam will do a 5-minutes-or-so one-on-one with each student to converse about your progress and also any questions you might have on the course material, etc. With 25+ students, this will take several hours, and we won't be able to get to everyone today. We'll just go in the order that you appear in the "People" page on Canvas.
  - Aliza is out sick today, so we'll be short a TA today.
  - ***DEEP BREATH***....... This kind of is a catch-up day for us, and also the day we leave the most wide-open and with the least amount of new content involved. Why?
  - Adult learning cycle: we need time to reflect.

  - Today we're focused on reviewing and developing a deeper understanding of what we've been building the past three days, and we're shifting our focus for the remainder of the week more to page layout and UI/UX concerns.
  - We know it's been a hard few days, but the class is doing well.
  - It's not to soon to start thinking about final projects. Let's have a brief conversation about that today, because a week from tomorrow you're going to be divided up into teams and starting on your projects.
  - Tomorrow we'll look at some projects from prior classes and talk a bit about what to expect from Project Week.
  - Learning Journal assignments: I apologize for the confusion on those. I finally figured out why they kept showing up even though I thought I deleted them last week. You should only see learning journal assignments on Mon-Wed-Fri going forward.
  - Today is Sam's wife's birthday, and Sam is going to try to get on his way home by about 5:00 or so this afternoon so that he can make dinner for her tonight. TAs will be available to assist through 6:00, as is usual.

- [Code Review](#codereview) *first half of class*
